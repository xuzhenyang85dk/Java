# 5th week of the 2nd semester
Topics: Algorithms, Recursion, Collections and Complexity



##Day 1 - Collections and efficiency
The goal is to get an understanding of how one views efficiency of computer programs. 

###Readings:

* [Theory of algorithms & big-O notation](study/complexity.md)

An alternative document to read wich covers approximately the same curriculum is [Peter Sestofts note on Search and Sort](study/SestoftSearchAndSort.pdf)

### Exercises:
* [Exercises](study/day1exercises.md)

##Day 2 - Recursion & binary trees
The goal is to be able to work with recursion - and in particular exemplified by binary trees.


###Readings:
The video's from Lynda.com gives the basics.

* [Binary tree](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Introduction-tree-data-structures/149042/177132-4.html?org=cphbusiness.dk) and [Binary Search Tree](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Understanding-binary-search-trees-BST/149042/177133-4.html?org=cphbusiness.dk) are well explained in these two sections at Linda.com

###Exercises:
* [Exercises from day2](study/day2excercises.md)

##Day 3 - Recursive sorting algorithms
Sorting is one of the most important fundamental issues in computing - we will look at some of the recursive sorting algorithms.
In particular we will look at merge sort and quick sort.

### Readings for quicksort

* [Slides](slides/day3Rekursive sorting algorithms.pptx)
* [Animation](http://me.dt.in.th/page/Quicksort/)

### Readings for mergesort

* [Slides](slides/day3Rekursive sorting algorithms.pptx)
* [Animation](http://visualgo.net/sorting) - pick merge sort

##Day 4 - Hashing & Recap
Today we will work on a few more algorithms and datastructures to ground the previous few days.

### Readings
* [Hashing & Hashmaps](https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Using-associative-arrays/149042/177125-4.html?org=cphbusiness.dk) - this section and the next two (three sections total "Using associative arrays", "Understanding hash functions" and "Using hash tables").

### Exercises
* [Exercises for day4](day4exercises.md)
* [Extra hard exercises](day4red.md)
 

##Day 5 - [Studypoint exercise](study/day5StudypointExercise.md)
